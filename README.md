<h1> Live Sentiment-Analysis with deployment on stream-lit</h1>
<br>

<h2> This project utilizes live webcam input to perform real-time sentiment analysis. By leveraging computer vision and Image Classification techniques, it identifies and analyzes facial expressions to determine the emotional state of the person in front of the camera.</h2>
<br>

<h2> Objective </h2>
1.Train a CNN model to detect faces and then classify the recieved face into 7 emotions (happy,sad,surprised,neutral,disgust,angry,fear).
<br>
2.Deploy the model using Streamlit. 
<br>

<h2> Tech-stack used </h2>
1. Tensorflow, keras, mobileNetv2 model for transfer learning(since I was new to transfer learning the kaggle community was really helpful)
<br>
2. OpenCV for Image Processing.
<br>
3. Streamlit_webrtc (so that webcam can be accessed from the net, and not inly limited to local system)
<br>
4. Streamlit for deployment
<br>
